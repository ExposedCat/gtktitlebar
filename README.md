# GTK Title Bar - Remove Title Bar for non-GTK Software
- This extension simply removes title bar on apps like Spotify and Qt5 apps when you maximize the windows for them.
- Unlike Unite (another extension with similar functionality), this does not remove window buttons for GTK apps.
- Makes the minimal change on your system's default behaviour.
- Supports GNOME 3.32 and 3.34 (for 3.28-3.30 support use the versions 3 and below)
- This work here is hardfork of [unite-shell](https://github.com/hardpixel/unite-shell) extension.
